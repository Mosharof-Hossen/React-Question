## React Core

### **1. What is React? (React ‡¶ï‡ßÄ?)**

React is a **JavaScript library** used for building user interfaces. It follows a **component-based architecture** and optimizes performance using the **virtual DOM**.

*React ‡¶π‡¶≤‡ßã ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø **JavaScript ‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∞‡¶ø**, ‡¶Ø‡¶æ **UI** ‡¶§‡ßà‡¶∞‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ú‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡ßÉ‡¶§ ‡¶π‡ßü‡•§ ‡¶è‡¶ü‡¶ø **component-based architecture** ‡¶Ö‡¶®‡ßÅ‡¶∏‡¶∞‡¶£ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç **virtual DOM** ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶´‡¶∞‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶∏ ‡¶Ö‡¶™‡¶ü‡¶ø‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶ú ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá‡•§*

### **2. What is the Virtual DOM? (Virtual DOM ‡¶ï‡ßÄ?)**

The Virtual DOM is a **lightweight copy** of the actual DOM that React uses to **efficiently update the UI**.
When you make changes in React, React first updates the **Virtual DOM** and then updates only the necessary changes to the **actual DOM**, making the app faster.

üîπ Why Virtual DOM is Important? (Virtual DOM ‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶® ‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶™‡ßÇ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶£?)

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Speed** ‚Üí Directly updating the **actual DOM** can be slow. By using the **Virtual DOM**, React makes updates more efficiently, improving speed.
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Efficiency** ‚Üí Instead of updating the whole page, React compares the old **Virtual DOM** with the new one and updates only the parts that have changed.

üîπ How React Uses Virtual DOM? (React ‡¶ï‡ßÄ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßá Virtual DOM ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá?)

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 1: React creates a Virtual DOM**

(React first creates the **Virtual DOM**, which is a virtual copy of the **actual DOM**.)

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 2: React updates Virtual DOM**

(When a **state** or **prop** changes, React makes those changes in the **Virtual DOM** first.)

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 3: React compares Virtual DOM with actual DOM**

(React compares the old **Virtual DOM** with the new **Virtual DOM**.)

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 4: React updates the actual DOM efficiently**

React ‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶¨‡¶≤‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶á ‡¶Ö‡¶Ç‡¶∂‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡ßã ‡¶Ü‡¶™‡¶°‡ßá‡¶ü ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶Ø‡¶æ ‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶§ ‡¶π‡ßü‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá, ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç ‡¶è‡¶§‡ßá **actual DOM**-‡¶è ‡¶Ö‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶™ ‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶§‡¶® ‡¶Ü‡¶∏‡ßá, ‡¶Ø‡¶æ ‡¶Ö‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶™‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶§ ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶ú ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá‡•§

(React updates only the parts that have changed, resulting in minimal changes to the **actual DOM**, which helps the app perform faster.)

üîπ Why Use Virtual DOM? (Virtual DOM ‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶® ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶â‡¶ö‡¶ø‡¶§?)

- Faster Updates
- Less Re-rendering
- Better Performance

### 3. React-‡¶è‡¶∞ Reconciliation ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡ßü‡¶æ ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶ñ‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶®‡•§

Reconciliation is the process where React updates the UI using the Virtual DOM. When  change a state or props, React compares the old and new Virtual DOM and updates only the changed parts in the actual DOM, making the app faster and more efficient.

### **4. What are the key features of React? (React-‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡ßÇ‡¶≤ ‡¶¨‡ßà‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶ï‡ßÄ ‡¶ï‡ßÄ?)**

- JSX (JavaScript XML) - JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension of JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
- Component-Based Architecture
- Virtual DOM
- Unidirectional Data Flow
- React Hooks
- Client-side Rendering (Next.js-‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶Æ‡ßá)

### **5. How many types of components are there in React? (React-‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶§ ‡¶ß‡¶∞‡¶®‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶™‡ßã‡¶®‡ßá‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ü ‡¶Ü‡¶õ‡ßá?)**

- **Class Component**
- **Functional Component** (Recommended in modern React)

### **6. What is the difference between a class component and a functional component?**

| Feature | Class Component | Functional Component |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syntax | Uses `class` keyword | Uses simple functions |
| State | Uses `this.state` | Uses `useState` hook |
| Performance | Less optimized | More optimized |
| Hooks Support | No | Yes |

### 7. What is Context API? (Context API ‡¶ï‡ßÄ?)

Context API allows **global state management** without prop drilling.

Context API is a built-in feature in React used to avoid props drilling. If a piece of data or state needs to be shared across multiple child components, then Context API should be used because it reduces the complexity of prop drilling.

### 8. State ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç Props-‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßá ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶•‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶ï‡ßÄ?

‚úÖ **State** ‚Üí **Component-‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ú‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶°‡¶æ‡¶ü‡¶æ**, ‡¶Ø‡¶æ ‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶§‡¶® (update) ‡¶π‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá‡•§
(**State is the component‚Äôs own data that can be changed.**)

‚úÖ **Props ‚Üí** Props are data passed from a parent component to a child component and cannot be modified by the child.

## Hooks And State

### 1. What is State in React? (React-‡¶è State ‡¶ï‡ßÄ?)

**State** is an **object** that stores data that can change over time. When the **state changes, the component automatically re-renders**, and the UI updates.

### 2. What are props in React? (React-‡¶è props ‡¶ï‡ßÄ?)

Props (short for "Properties") are **read-only data** passed from **parent to child components**.

### 3. React Hooks (React Hooks ‡¶ï‡ßÄ?)

React Hooks are special functions that allow you to use **state and lifecycle features** inside a **React functional component** without using a **class component**.

üîπ Why Use Hooks? (Hooks ‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶® ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶¨?)

‡¶Ü‡¶ó‡ßá React Class Component-‡¶è state ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç lifecycle method (‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶Æ‡¶® componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate) ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶π‡¶§‡ßã‡•§ ‡¶ï‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡ßÅ Hooks ‡¶Ü‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡¶∞ ‡¶è‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡ßã Functional Component-‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶á ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡ßü, ‡¶Ø‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶°‡¶ï‡ßá clean, short ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç ‡¶∏‡¶π‡¶ú ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶§‡ßã‡¶≤‡ßá‡•§ 

(Before Hooks, React Class Components were required to use state and lifecycle methods (like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate). But with Hooks, we can now do these inside a Functional Component, making the code clean, short, and simple.)

### 4. What is useEffect in React? (React-‡¶è useEffect ‡¶ï‡ßÄ?)

`useEffect` is a hook used for handling **side effects** in React components (e.g., API calls, subscriptions).

| **useEffect() (‡¶á‡¶â‡¶ú‡¶è‡¶´‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶ü)** | **useLayoutEffect() (‡¶á‡¶â‡¶ú‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶Ü‡¶â‡¶ü‡¶è‡¶´‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶ü)** |
| --- | --- |
| **useEffect()** runs asynchronously after the component renders, meaning it does not block the UI | useLayoutEffect() runs synchronously after the component renders but before the UI update, which may block rendering. |
| useEffect() is good for API calls, event listeners, data fetching, and subscriptions because it runs in the background. | useLayoutEffect() is useful for DOM manipulation, layout measurements, and animations because it executes before the browser paints the screen. |

### 5. useReducer() ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç useState() ‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßá ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶®‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡¶ñ‡¶® ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶®?

| useState() | useReducer() |
| --- | --- |
| useState() is best for simple state management, where the state is a single value or a few values. | useReducer() is best for complex state logic, where the state depends on multiple actions or updates. |
| useState() is easier to use |  |
|  |  |

### 6. Redux ? ,‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ß‡¶æ‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡ßã ‡¶ï‡ßÄ?

‚úÖ **Redux** is a state management library that helps manage and centralize the state of JavaScript applications. It can be used with frameworks like **React**, **Angular**, or any other JavaScript framework.

Redux-‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ß‡¶æ‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡ßã (Advantages of Redux):

- Centralized State Management
- **Redux** makes state changes predictable
- Debugging Support:  With **Redux DevTools**, developers can track state changes and analyze how the app is functioning.
- Ease of Maintenance
- Middleware Support: **Redux** supports **middleware** like **redux-thunk.**

## Performance Optimization:

### How to optimize performance in React? (React-‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶´‡¶∞‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶∏ ‡¶ï‡ßÄ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßá ‡¶Ö‡¶™‡¶ü‡¶ø‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶ú ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡ßü?)

- **Using React.memo** (Prevents unnecessary re-renders)
- **Using useCallback & useMemo** (Optimizes function and value references)
- **Efficiently updating the state**
- **Avoiding unnecessary re-renders with key props**

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR) ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç Server-Side Rendering (SSR)-‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶•‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶Ø

| **Aspect** | **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** | **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **How it works** | The browser loads a minimal HTML file, then fetches JavaScript, which dynamically updates the UI using data from API calls. | The server generates the HTML content with data, and sends it to the browser, which displays the complete page immediately. |
| **Initial Load Time** | Initial load can be slow as JavaScript and data need to load before rendering. | Faster initial load as the full HTML page is delivered to the browser. |
| **SEO Performance** | SEO can be less effective as search engines might have difficulty indexing content that is rendered client-side. | SSR provides better SEO performance since the content is already rendered when the page is loaded. |
| **Use Case** | Ideal for Single Page Applications (SPA) where content is updated dynamically. | Suitable for static websites or applications that require faster initial page loads, such as blogs, news sites, or e-commerce pages. |
